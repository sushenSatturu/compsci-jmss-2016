'''
1. String concatenation:
        	x="cat"
        	y="dog"

        	What does x+y equal?


Write a for loop that takes a list of words
words=["cat","dog","fish","sugar glider","frog","rabbit"]
makes it into one string and prints out that string.
'''

words = ["cat","dog","fish","sugar glider","frog","rabbit"]

for word in words:

# 2. Now INSIDE the for loop, search for a particular word and change it in the
# final string. Eg search for "cat" and change it to "dog" before you create the string.

# 3. Change your for loop to use the index instead of the items.
